# kali

Kali is a simple functional programming language, developed during my time at the University of Cambridge.

## Features

Since I'm not particularly good at writing compilers, Kali is a very simple language. It has:

-   Common primitive types: `Int`, `Bool`, `Char`, `String`
-   Higher-order functions with currying
-   Algebraic data types
-   Pattern matching
-   Recursion
-   Type inference
